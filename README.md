On this implementantion you will see a customized form and features such as:

- Keyboard not overlapping the text fields;
- Pressing the keyboard's Return button you'll go to the next text field;
- Wrong fields with red background colour;
- And the clean up of all fields at once.

To be sure that everything is running as waited, alerts are being diplayed through the buttons actions.
